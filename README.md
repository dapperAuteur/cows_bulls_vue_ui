> ui for cows and bulls word game

## Description:
#### Cows & Bulls is a word game that a friend taught me while we were driving through the mountains of Guatemala. We used it as a tool to calm us. It helped us relieve the anxiety of driving with near 0 visibility on poor mountain roads during the rain storms.

## Rules:
#### Player 1 thinks of a four letter word and Player 2 must guess the word.
#### After each guess, Player 1 replies with the number of Cows and Bulls Player 2 has.
#### A Cow means that the guess has the correct letter but in the wrong place.
#### A Bull means the guess has the correct letter in the correct place.
#### Each guess resets the number of Cows and Bulls.
#### Player 1 doesn't say which letter is the Cow or Bull.
#### The game continues until Player 2 has 4 Bulls.

#### API is built using Elixir/Phoenix and is hosted at: https://peaceful-forest-74170.herokuapp.com/api/0001/players/
